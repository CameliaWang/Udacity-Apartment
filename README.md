# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

I really like this project, because there is no specific requirements for the arrangement of the appartment and I can put the furnitures anywhere I like. This project is a good way to practice my Unity skills, because I've encountered some problems while doing it, such as Trigger Animation for the globe spin, light settings and position settinhgs. It took me 8 hours to complete it, since I am a beginner to Unity.
